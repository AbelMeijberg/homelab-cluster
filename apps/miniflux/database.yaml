# CloudNativePG PostgreSQL Cluster for Miniflux
#
# This demonstrates the Operator Pattern:
# - We declare a "Cluster" custom resource (CRD)
# - The CNPG operator watches for these and provisions PostgreSQL
# - It automatically creates:
#   - A StatefulSet with PostgreSQL pods
#   - Services for read/write and read-only access
#   - Secrets with connection credentials (miniflux-db-app, miniflux-db-superuser)
#   - PVCs for data storage
#
# The secret "miniflux-db-app" will contain:
#   username, password, host, port, dbname, uri (full connection string)
