# CloudNativePG Operator values for homelab
# Manages PostgreSQL databases across the cluster via the Cluster CRD
#
# The Operator Pattern:
# - This Helm chart installs a "controller" that watches for Cluster CRDs
# - When you create a Cluster resource, the operator provisions PostgreSQL
# - It handles: pod creation, replication, failover, backups, credential rotation
# - You declare WHAT you want, the operator figures out HOW

# Resource limits for homelab single-node setup

    memory: 64Mi
